# Note from the author(s)

This styling is only temporary while we work on the new style definition which styles all components separately, as gatsby should do. This is remnant of using styling from the parallel pulsar-based system, which will also get reworked when we get to it. 

TLDR: We know CSS is currently pretty shitty. It has bloated over time, as we iterated quickly. We are working on it as highest priority now :) If you have what it takes and would like to help us, join us! Write our CEO or CTO on our Discord and let's talk: https://community.supernova.io/
